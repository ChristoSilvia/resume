	\noindent
	I wrote a path-planning algorithm to improve ambulance response times.
	The algorithm allows ambulances to exploit their idle time by
driving through more accident-prone areas.
	I implemented the algorithm using Python's NetworkX library,
as well as a custom heap implementation which allowed for
efficient in-place modification.

	\noindent
	I investigated properties of solutions to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation on
		the Serpinski Gasket, a fractal space.
	I numerically solved the differential equation through discretization
		with a novel scheme, and equalled the previous theoretical bound
		on precision solutions for differential equations of this type.

	\noindent
	I investigated the dynamics of micromagentic systems.
	I used and wrote programs to simulate micromagnetic dynamics and produce
		theoretical predictions about the geometry-dependend properties
		of small ferromagnetic materials.

	\noindent
	I created a system to deploy servers automatically to execute
    hadoop and storm queries on a large dataset of healthcare
    records, as well as automated other systems administration tasks.

	\noindent
      I created a console to display active jobs and broken nodes
      on a computer cluster at NIST and repaired broken computers.

  \section{Skills}
	\noindent
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Creating and analyzing numerical models, which used both 
		linear algebra and differential equations to predict the behavior of a system, 
		and experience writing executive summaries \LaTeX to summarize my findings to a nontechnical audience.
	\item Writing robot control systems with Linux, Robot Operating System
		(ROS) using Python (numpy/scipy).
	\item Designing mechanical systems on a FIRST robotics
		competition robot using Autodesk Inventor, 
		as well as acting as lead engineer.
	\item Working on teams to deliver projects and write-ups
		in engineering and mathematical modeling classes,
		some involving collaborating on a significant amount of shared
		code using Git.
	\end{itemize}
